# AI-Driven Facial Animation from Audio
This project enables users to generate animated videos where facial expressions match the spoken content of an audio file. By utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), this system animates faces based on the audio input. The project also uses deep learning models to drive these animations, enabling users to sync audio with facial movements in a seamless video.

Features
Generate animated videos where the facial expressions are synchronized with the audio.

Speech-to-text processing to recognize spoken words and use them as input for the animation.

Use of GANs to generate realistic facial animations based on audio content.

Installation and Setup
Prerequisites
Make sure that you have CUDA enabled for GPU acceleration in your environment to ensure faster processing of large models and animations. Here’s how to enable it in Google Colab:

Go to Edit → Notebook settings → Set Hardware accelerator to GPU.

Running the Project in Google Colab
This project is best run on Google Colab for faster processing, especially with GPU acceleration. Running it on Colab ensures better computational resources without overloading your local machine. Colab provides free access to GPUs, significantly speeding up the training and inference process, especially for tasks requiring high computational power like generating GAN-based animations.

Steps to Run the Project:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/Sagar-19143/SadTalker.git
cd SadTalker
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Install Additional Packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pydub SpeechRecognition gtts opencv-python-headless ipywidgets
Mount Google Drive (for saving the models and outputs):

python
Copy
Edit
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Download Pre-trained Models:

bash
Copy
Edit
bash scripts/download_models.sh
Upload Source Image and Audio: Upload your image (face) and audio file (preferably .wav format for better processing) via the interface provided.

Run Inference:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 inference.py --driven_audio <path_to_audio> --source_image <path_to_image> --result_dir <result_directory> --expression_scale 1.5 --preprocess crop
Input
The project requires two types of inputs:

Source Image: This should be a clear image of a face (preferably frontal). The image will be used to generate the animated facial expressions.

Format: .jpg, .png

Driven Audio: The audio file containing the speech that will drive the animation. The audio is processed for speech-to-text conversion and synchronized with the face's animation.

Format: .wav (for optimal results)

Output
The output will be a video with a synchronized facial animation based on the input audio. The result is saved as an .mp4 file.

Output Format: .mp4

Explanation of Results
After running the inference script, the system will generate a video with the facial animation synced to the audio. The key features of the results are:

The expression scale can be adjusted to modify how exaggerated or subtle the facial expressions appear.

The output video will showcase the source image’s face performing lip-sync and facial movements based on the audio.

Here’s an example of how the generated video looks:

bash
Copy
Edit
Result saved at: /path/to/results/generated_video.mp4
Sample Execution Flow
User uploads a source image and an audio file.

Speech-to-text processing extracts the speech from the audio file.

Facial animation generation takes place through the pre-trained GAN model using the source image and the extracted speech content.

Resulting video is displayed as an animated video with synchronized lip movements and expressions.

Visualization
The result video is automatically embedded into the Colab notebook after processing, allowing the user to preview the generated animation.
